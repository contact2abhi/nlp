Puri, Yogesh Vaidya and Subhash Arora) started selling teledigital calculators to gather capital for their main product. On 11 August 1976, the company was renamed Hindustan Computers Limited (HCL).[12] HCL Enterprise developed an indigenous microcomputer in 1978,[13] and a RDBMS, networking OS and client-server architecture in 1983.[14] HCL Technologies began as the R&D division of HCL Enterprise.[15]\n",
